# Car Rental Application (Work in Progress)

The Full-Stack Car Rental Application is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate the rental process for both customers and administrators. It is built using modern technologies like Spring Boot, Angular, Ng Zorro, and MySQL, offering a range of features to streamline car rental operations.

## Key Features

- **Admin and Customer Roles**: The system includes two distinct roles - Admin and Customer - each with specific functionalities tailored to their needs.
- **Admin's Toolbox**: Admins can perform CRUD operations on car listings, utilize advanced search functions, and manage booking requests by approving or rejecting them.
- **Customer Convenience**: Customers can browse available cars, search using advanced filters, request bookings, and track their booking history.
- **CORS Configuration**: Implemented CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration class in Spring Boot for secure cross-origin requests.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented a robust Login API to generate JWT (JSON Web Token) in Spring Boot, following best practices for securing authentication tokens and preventing token tampering.
- **Role-Based Navigation**: Implemented functionality for seamless navigation based on user roles, directing logged-in users to their respective dashboards.
